## README – Management Lab App

### Description

This JavaScript console application allows users to manage products and numerical sets through a text-based menu system.
It provides a simple interactive interface using `prompt`, `alert`, and `console.log`.

### Functionality

* **Products management:**

  * Add a new product with ID, name, category, and price.
  * Display products using two methods (`for...of` and `Object.entries`).
  * Group and display products by category.
* **Sets management:**

  * Add numbers to a Set (ignores duplicates).
  * Verify if a number exists in the Set.
  * Display all numbers in the Set.
  * Delete a number from the Set.
* Input validation ensures IDs are unique and all numeric or alphabetic fields are correctly entered.
* Data persistence is handled via `localStorage`.

### Purpose

Practice conditional logic, loops, user input validation, `Set` operations, and browser storage, all in a menu-driven application.
